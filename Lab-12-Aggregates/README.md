## 📖 Overview
This repository covers data summarization techniques using SQL aggregate functions. It demonstrates how to collapse row-level information into meaningful business intelligence metrics using whole-table calculations, categorical groupings, group-level filtering, relational joins, and concludes with the comprehensive **University Database Assessment Problem**[cite: 18].

## 🧠 Concepts Applied
* **Core Aggregates:** Utilized `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()` to evaluate volume, pricing, and student performance metrics[cite: 18].
* **Null Handling & Distinct Metrics:** Managed `NULL` behaviors and applied `COUNT(DISTINCT)` to isolate unique categories, cities, and student locations[cite: 18].
* **Categorical Grouping (`GROUP BY`):** Structured multi-row outputs into per-category and per-department reports following standard execution rules[cite: 18].
* **Group Filtering (`HAVING`):** Differentiated row-level pre-filtering (`WHERE`) from post-aggregation group filtering (`HAVING`)[cite: 18].
* **Complex Joins & Subqueries:** Blended `LEFT JOIN` and `INNER JOIN` operations with aggregate functions to capture zero-activity metrics and top-performing entities[cite: 18].

## 📁 Files Included
* `Lab 12_Mahdi Ali_16.sql`: A fully self-contained script containing the Retail Store schema setup, test data insertion, Parts A & B aggregate queries, and the complete University Database Assessment (Q1–Q12)[cite: 18].

## 🚀 How to Run
Execute the `.sql` script in any MySQL environment. It will independently establish the required databases (`agg_lab` and `uni_lab`), populate the interconnected tables, and automatically run the complete sequence of aggregate operations and assessment queries[cite: 18].
